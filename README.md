# Quick Install

```
curl -L https://github.com/aarron-lee/PowerControl/raw/main/install.sh | sh
```

# Desktop App

There is also a [Desktop app](https://github.com/aarron-lee/PowerControl-Electron), which has separate install instructions.

The Desktop app is currently outdated and uses PowerControl version 2.1.0, and will be updated when possible to use the latest 2.7.1

See the desktop app readme for instructions.
